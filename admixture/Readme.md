Results of [admixture](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/9/1655) analysis of world/European populations. <br>
.fam files were modified using population descriptions from 1000 genomes. <br>
The *populations.csv* file is useful for matching 1000 genomes ID's to populations and super-populations.<br>
The results of study with all the 1000 genomes world populations (from the MergeFullForPCA file):<br>
